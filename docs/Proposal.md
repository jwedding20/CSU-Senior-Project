Project Statement: WIP

Project Description: My project is a game of checkers that will be played between two players on different computers. There will be a waiting room where players will be placed until their opponent has joined. The game will begin once both players have joined the room. When selecting (clicking on) a piece to move, only spaces that are open will be available for selection. The program will prompt users to perform a double or triple jump if possible. If a player's piece reaches the opponent's side of the board, it will turn into a "king" piece. A message will come across the screen when one player has won the game. Once this occurs the game will end, and players will have the option to play again.

Proposed Implementation Language: Python, JavaScript

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc: Visual Studio Code, GitHub, HTML

Additional Software: N/A

Personal Motivation: This project with grow my knowledge of software development, particularly in Python, JavaScript, and HTML. This project will also improve my knowledge of user interface programming, as the program needs to be very user interface friendly. Furthermore, I will gain experience planning, constructing, and defending a program.

Outline of Future Research Efforts: I need to learn how to connect two players on different computers. I also need to learn how to code in JavaScript and how to get Python, JavaScript, and HTML to work together.

Schedule:

- Game code will be completed by the end of February 2024
- Networking side will be completed by end of March 2024
- Testing will be completed by mid-April 2024
- Program will be defended by December 2024
