Project Statement: WIP

Project Description: My project is a game of checkers that will be played between two players on the same computer. On the menu screen, there will be several versions of checkers to choose from. The game will begin once players select the mode they want to play. When selecting (clicking on) a piece to move, only spaces that are open will be available for selection. The program will prompt users to perform a double or triple jump if possible. If a player's piece reaches the opponent's side of the board, it will turn into a "king" piece. A message will come across the screen when one player has won the game. Once this occurs the game will end, and players will have the option to play again.

Proposed Implementation Language: Java

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc: Apache Netbeans, Github

Additional Software: N/A

Personal Motivation: This project with grow my knowledge of software development, particularly in Java. This project will also improve my knowledge of GUI, as the program is very GUI heavy. Furthermore, I will gain experience planning, constructing, and defending a program.

Outline of Future Research Efforts: N/A

Schedule: Program is expected to be completed in May 2024 and will be defended November 2024.
